# P-10 Menu for EmulationStation

This is a tranlation of the Playchoice-10 menu interface for the version of EmulationStation used in [Batocera (v40 and above)](https://batocera.org/).

This version of the theme only works with distributions that use the latest Batocera (v40 and above) fork of EmulationStation.  Specifically [Batocera](https://batocera.org/), [Knulli](https://www.knulli.org/), [RockNIX](https://rocknix.org/) and [RetroBat](https://www.retrobat.org/)

My work focused on tranlating the layout so that it could be buildable in the theme engine for EmulationStation.  Please refer to the `Changes Made` section below for additional details.

The original version of the UI can be found as part of the Playchoice-10 arcade hardware.

## Changes Made

- Used screenshots of Playchoice-10 menu to approximate the components that would be used build a theme compatible with EmulationStation.
- Changed the helpsystem to EmulationStation's native component and created a layout that tries to evoke the original helpsystem design (sadly it can't be a 1:1 translation due to differences in the theme engines)
- Added icons specific to EmulationStation functionality
- Created a custom set of pixel icons for the helpsystem
- Added a framework for adding additional color schemes

You can also create your own custom color scheme by following the instructions under "[Creating your own color scheme](#creating-your-own-color-scheme)"
 
## Theme Customizations

P-10 Menu allows customizations to color schemes without the need to edit the source XML.  This enables you to change the look of the theme and still retain your changes when the theme is updated.

### Start Here
- Make sure the `Distribution` setting is set to the correct value for your current OS (e.g. Batocera/Knulli, RockNIX or RetroBat)
- This value determines the folder where you will add your customizations
    - Batocera/Knulli = `/userdata/theme-customizations/p-10-menu/`
    - RockNIX = `/roms/_userdata/theme-customizations/p-10-menu/`
    - Retrobat = `C:\RetroBat\emulationstation\.emulationstation\theme-customizations\p-10-menu\`
- Create the folders that match your distribution and then move on to the options below...

### Color Schemes

* Download this template: https://github.com/anthonycaccese/p-10-menu-es/blob/main/resources/customizations/colors.xml
* Upload it to the path you created above and make sure its called `colors.xml`
* Change any values in the template to the colors you prefer.
* I tried to make the values as self explanatory as possible but if you have questions regarding which property does what please don't hesitate to ask.
* After your colors are defined; in theme configuration change `Color Scheme` to `Custom`

If you make a custom color scheme and are comfortable with sharing I would love to check it out ðŸ˜Š
- Please feel free to create an issue in this repo called `Custom Color Scheme: [Name of your Color Scheme]`
- Include the values you used for the properties above (xml is preferred) and a screenshot of what it looks like.

## **Additional Notes**

### Versions for other ES forks:
* If you use ES-DE... then the ES-DE version [here](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/p-10-menu-es-de) will work out of the box with that distribution.  When used with ES-DE the theme comes with additional support for navigation sound sets.
